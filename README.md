# TDD Study case: Pizza Planet

## What is TDD?

### "Ok, Google"

> _Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass._

### Steps

1. Add minimal set of tests for a (new) feature
2. Run all tests. The new test is expected to fail
3. Write the code for the feature
4. Run all tests again
5. Refactor code (kind of optionnal but better)
6. Repeat

### Summary

#### Advantages

- Makes the developer focus on the requirements before writing the code

#### Drawbacks

- Needs well defined requirements

## Let's code

_The backend has been coded beforehand, we need to add a new fonctionnality now: XXX_

### Requirements
